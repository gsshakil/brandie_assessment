# brandie_assessment

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The Project idea is inspired by Brandie iteslf along with some other apps like Yelp, Tripadvosrs where people share review or story of the perticular place, brand, product etc. So, this could have a good business model by providing businesses more insighfull data and contents as well as for the end users who could be benifited via an affiliate programme by earning a reward points which they could use to buy real products from the Apps own store or any other benifits.

The app currently has several activites/screen.
1. Splash
2. Login Screen
3. Landing Screen 
4. Home Screen
5. Profile Screen
6. Product Details Screen
7. Add Review Screen
8. Search Screen(mockup)

For now this is just a humlbe beging of the idea whe user can signup/login via their Google account with one single tap and we will collect their basic data like name, profile picture email etc.

Then we will present some of our partners data(For now its just showing few products form Saleor graphql api, I used this because i havn't found much resource on open graphql apis which have images to show). Their users can see the details and others reviews on this particuler post/topic/product/place/brand/restaurants and also add their own. They can also share the Product to various platforms via a link.

For now i have used Firebase for Google Authentication, Adding Review Functionality and deeplink which has very bare bone structure.

The project would be great and complete enough to hand to the users if it has some very good data from partners(topic/product/place/brand/restaurants) and an advance Search and Filter option to find that specifiec brand/content. 
User also could upload multiple images or videos. 
There could be rating systems and a way to give reviewrs reward points and withdrawel system.
User can also like, comment and share other users reviews.
There could be tranding/Editors choice sections where there will be curated list of recommanded contents for the specific user.
